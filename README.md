## Overview
This is a simple calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a graphical user interface to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** with buttons for easy input.
- Supports basic operations:
  - **‚ûï Addition (`+`)**
  - **‚ûñ Subtraction (`-`)**
  - **‚úñÔ∏è Multiplication (`*`)**
  - **‚ûó Division (`/`)** (Handles division by zero gracefully.)
- Clear button to reset the current input.
- Result display with rounded values for division.

- **Python 3.x**  
  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

- **Tkinter library**  
  Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python in most distributions. If it's not installed, you can install it using:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # For Linux

## üöÄ How it works
### 1. Start the Application:
- Run the Python script: python calculator.py.
### 2. Input Numbers:
- Use the numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
### 3. Perform Operations:
- Click an operator button (+, -, *, /) after entering the first number.
- Enter the second number, then press the = button to calculate the result.
### 4. Clear Input:
- Press the C button to clear the current input and start fresh.
